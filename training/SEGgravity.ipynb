    "# Introduction\n",
    "In the petroleum industry, seismic data is the most common geophysical method employed to help us link surface and well data to subsurface structures. For geoscientists, it's important to understand the spatial and/or temporal changes in gravitational or magnetic potential fields can help us identify spatial and temporal changes in the earth. \n",
    "\n",
    "Gravity and magnetic data are therefore potential field measurments: \n",
    "* A field is a physical quantity that has a value for each point in space and time.\n",
    "* Potential is the amount of energy an object has due to its position within a field. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are several situations in which gravity and magnetic data may be used to enhance our understanding of the subsurface:\n",
    "1. For global scales: Gravity and magnetic data can be aquired by satallite to provide global scale data sets. These can help map ocean bathymetry, seafloor spreading, and longer wavelength variations in the potential fields. \n",
    "2. For basin scales: Gravity and magnetic data can be aquired from the air or by boat, making it viable on regional scales where seismic aquisition might be cost-prohibitive. Air aquistion can also be very useful in areas where land access is an issue. For example, due to terrain, vegitation, or security issues. \n",
    "3. Areas with poor seismic imaging: Seismic imaging in areas with high density variations, such as salt basins, can be problematic. These types of areas can be better understood and resolved when used in conjunction with gravity data. Seismic aquisition also has limitations on the imaging of very deep areas due to source strength and seismic wave attenuation with depth. Gravity and magetic data can be used to understand variations in hte basement depth, lithology and deep crustal structures that the seismic cannot image. "

    "At an astronomical scale, the assumption of a uniform Earth represented by a center of mass at the planet's center works well. However, as geoscientists we know that Earth is made up of rocks of very different densities, both with depth and laterally. Therfore, the assumption of constant g with constant r at Earth's surface will not be totally accurate. \n",

    "\n",
    "Instead of one point mass at teh center of the planet, Earth may be considered as being comprised of many point masses. These many point masses contribute to how a body at the planet's surface is affected by the gravitaitoal attraction. Due to the strong dependence of gravity to distance, nearer (or shallower) mass contrasts will have a much larger effect than more distant ones, which is why gravity surveying works. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to quantify the effect of many point masses on an object we need ot use the Priniple of Superposition this is a general princple that says the net force actign on a body is the sum of the individual effects. To see how this works, explore the following interaction.\n",
